# Otako-Food

The script uses the inventory metadate. Each nutritional product that you buy in the store has an expiry date. When eaten before the expiration date, it normally adds a bit of food to us. On the other hand, if we eat the expired ones, we start to feel dizzy, only add a little bit of food, and our health level drops. Project is [STANDALONE].

Dependencies: Inventory with metadata.
